import IO -- module names are PascalCase, all imports must be at the start
          -- of a file.

print "Hello World" -- functions names are camelCase, strings
                    -- surrounded by double quotes.

-- when a file doesn't have a main function, all top level statements are
-- implicitly gathered into a "do" block.
print "This is also going to be printed"


-- variables are snake case
